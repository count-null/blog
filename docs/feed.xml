      Bitcoin will be sucessfully attacked because it’s security is trending down despite rising hashrate. It must suffer an assult (perhaps multiple blows) in order to correctly price the minimum cost of security. Proof-of-Work systems with a decreasing issuance schedule are performing a security budget optimization in real-time.

Let me explain…

      If you operate a Lightning Network node for profit, one of your biggest costs are on chain channel opening fees. Exchanges have been batching bitcoin transactions for years. Batching transactions is an obvious and easy way to save significantly on fees.

      How many hours have you spent on hold with your bank or credit card company? Navigating through phone menus, listening to robotic monologues telling you how much they care about you while they waste your time. We have to put up with this in part as a security procedure. When you finially get another human on the line, they’ll likely ask for your SSN, security questions, birthday, etc. All this ...

      The Lightning Network ecosystem is expanding to include all kinds of nifty websites and apps.

Most of these app are on central servers. They use LN for it’s payments ability, not to make a distributed application.

There are some apps that are hosted on lightning nodes. These include BTCPayServer and Sphinx Chat. Sphinx enables encrypted communication over LN protocol. You can attach a payment...

      Here’s an overview of what happens when you make a transaction:

When you broadcast a transaction, it must be sent from a node to all its peers. Each transaction has a fee rate measured in sats per byte. Bitcoin allows you to choose whatever fee you want! However, some wallets do not let you choose a fee.

For example, if your transaction takes up 269 bytes of space on the block chain, and you ...
